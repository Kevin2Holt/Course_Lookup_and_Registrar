The instructions recommend using a readme file to test the pull request (collaboration) features.
To make things simple, just put your name below and then request a merge.
That way, we can all be sure that we understand how to do it.

When editing, commit changes to a new branch and start a pull request.
	If on github.com, there is a "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option.
	I'm not sure about other tools.
This will prevent issues arising from multiple people editing the same file.
